

## 1) Page goal and success criteria

### Goal

Help clients quickly pick **Package A / B / C**, understand why costs differ (**API + Template + Website build/ops**), then convert via CTA (“Get quote”, “Book call”, “Run demo”).

### Success metrics (track in analytics)

* Plan card CTA click rate (A/B/C)
* “Info icon opened” rate per row (shows what people don’t understand)
* Add-on attach rate
* FAQ expand rate (top 5 questions)
* Lead form completion rate

---

## 2) Information architecture (top → bottom)

1. **Hero + one-line value**
2. **Top comparison block (pricing + matrix)** ✅ must be at the top
3. **Add-ons block** ✅ must be directly below comparison
4. **FAQ / Q&A block** ✅ focused on API cost, template cost, storage cost, etc.
5. **Pros & Cons block** ✅ must be at the bottom
6. **Final CTA + footer**

This structure fits common pricing-page expectations (pricing + compare + FAQ). ([mrrunlocked.com][2])

---

## 3) Core UI components and behavior

### 3.1 Hero (above the fold)

**Elements**

* Headline: “AI Image Landing Page for Events — Choose the Right Package”
* Subhead: “Pricing is driven by API usage, template complexity, and website features/hosting/support.”
* Primary CTA: “Get a Proposal”
* Secondary CTA: “See Package Comparison”

---

### 3.2 Top comparison block (cards + comparison matrix)

#### A) Plan cards (3 columns)

Keep **exactly 3 tiers** to reduce decision fatigue and keep the choice simple. ([Simon-Kucher][3])

Each card includes:

* Package name + short tagline
* “Best for” (1 line)
* Price area (you can show **Starting from** or **Request quote**)
* CTA button
* Mini bullets (3 bullets max; details live in the matrix popovers)

**Package names (recommended)**

* **Package A — Basic (Stateless)**
* **Package B — Insight (Metadata + Dashboard)**
* **Package C — Platform (Database + Users + Reporting)**

#### B) Comparison matrix (right under cards)

Use a **static comparison table** (3 plans is perfect) with grouped rows. ([Nielsen Norman Group][1])

**Matrix layout**

* Left column: Row title + **info icon**
* Columns: A / B / C
* Cell values: ✅ Included / ◐ Optional / — Not included / “Level 1/2/3”

#### C) Three row groups (tabs or segmented control)

At the top of the matrix: a toggle with 3 views:

1. **Features included**
2. **What client gets**
3. **What end-users get**

This is where you satisfy your requirement: **title-only** rows in the table, with **rich detail on hover/click**.

---

### 3.3 Info icon details (your “must be more” requirement)

**Important UX note:** If the detail is long/important, treat it as a **popover** (not a tiny tooltip). Popovers are meant for longer explanations; tooltips are meant for short labels. ([Red Hat design system][4])

#### Interaction rules (desktop + mobile + accessibility)

* Desktop: open on **hover** *and* **keyboard focus**, pin on **click**
* Mobile: open on **tap** (hover doesn’t exist on touch devices)
* Popover must be:

  * **Dismissible** (close button + Esc)
  * **Hoverable** (pointer can move into it)
  * **Persistent** until dismissed (doesn’t vanish when user tries to read)
  * This aligns with WCAG “Content on Hover or Focus”. ([W3C][5])

#### Popover content template (consistent everywhere)

Each info popover shows:

* **Definition** (what the feature means)
* **What we build** (implementation scope)
* **Why it costs more/less** (drivers)
* **Impact** (token waste / reliability / operations)
* **Example** (1 short example)

Also add a “**Expand all details**” link that opens a full “Details” panel for people who hate hover-reading (this also avoids hiding critical info behind hover). NN/g warns against relying on tooltips for vital info. ([Nielsen Norman Group][6])

---

## 4) Content spec (what goes in each package)

Below is the **exact content inventory** you need to create in your CMS or JSON config.
Each row has:

* `title` (shown in table)
* `detail` (shown in popover — MUST be longer)
* `A/B/C value` (✅ / ◐ / — / Level)

Tooltip/popover usage for “explain features in pricing” is common, but keep it accessible and not hover-only. ([Smashing Magazine][7])

---

## 6) FAQ / Q&A section spec (cost questions)

### Layout

* Accordion list (10–14 questions)
* Add a “Search FAQ” input (filters questions)
* Each answer includes:

  * short summary (1–2 lines)
  * bullet breakdown (cost drivers)
  * “Which package is affected?” (A/B/C tags)

### Must-have FAQ questions (focused on API cost, template cost, storage cost)

1. **How is AI API cost calculated?**
2. **What makes token usage higher or lower?**
3. **How do you prevent wasting tokens on bad uploads?**
4. **What is “template cost” vs “API cost”?**
5. **What does “simple template” mean vs “complex multi-step template”?**
6. **Do we store user images and generated outputs?**
7. **What storage costs should we expect (metadata vs full images)?**
8. **Can we choose not to store anything (stateless)?**
9. **Can the client use their own AI API key to pay providers directly?**
10. **What happens if the AI provider changes pricing or limits?**
11. **What’s included in deployment & hosting cost?**
12. **What’s included in documentation & maintenance?**
13. **Can we upgrade from A → B → C later?**
14. **What about privacy/consent for user-uploaded photos? (recommended)**

### Structured data note (SEO)

You *can* add FAQ structured data, but Google has limited FAQ rich results for most sites since 2023 (mainly authoritative gov/health). It can still help structure content, but don’t expect rich-result display. ([Google for Developers][8])

---

## 7) Pros & Cons block (must be at the bottom)

Design:

* 3 columns (A/B/C), each with:

  * **Pros** list
  * **Cons** list
  * “Best for” one-liner

Content (keep it blunt and clear):

### Package A — Pros

* Fastest + cheapest launch
* No backend/DB complexity
* Great for one-time events

**Cons**

* No saved history; refresh wipes results
* No analytics/dashboard
* Hard to control cost beyond basic checks

### Package B — Pros

* Captures user behavior (metadata)
* Dashboard visibility + event monitoring
* Lower wasted tokens via better QA/QC and prompts

**Cons**

* Doesn’t store full images/outputs long-term
* More infra than A

### Package C — Pros

* Full database of users + inputs + outputs
* Best reporting + future monetization
* Most “real product” experience

**Cons**

* Highest build + maintenance scope
* Requires stronger security/ops

---

## 8) Non-negotiable implementation requirements (so this doesn’t break UX)

1. **Popover over tooltip for long content** (your details are “more,” so popover) ([Red Hat design system][4])
2. **Accessible hover/focus content** (dismissible/hoverable/persistent) ([W3C][5])
3. **Mobile behavior**: info icons open on tap (not hover)
4. **Comparison table stays readable** on small screens:

   * sticky first column
   * horizontal scroll with fade indicator
5. **“Expand all details” fallback** so people don’t need to hunt tooltips for critical understanding ([Nielsen Norman Group][6])

---

## 9) Dev handoff: data model (CMS/JSON)

You can hand this to devs as the content contract:

* `packages[]`: { id, name, tagline, bestFor, priceText, ctaText, ctaLink }
* `comparisonViews[]` (3): “features”, “client_gets”, “user_benefits”
* `rows[]`: { viewId, rowId, title, detailHtml, values: {A,B,C} }
* `addons[]`: { id, title, priceType, short, detailHtml, compatiblePackages }
* `faqs[]`: { q, answerHtml, tags: [api, template, storage, hosting, maintenance] }
* `prosCons`: { packageId, pros[], cons[] }

---

If you want, I can also output **ready-to-paste copy** for every single popover (`detailHtml`) and the full FAQ answers in a consistent tone (so your landing page reads like a premium proposal, not a basic pricing table).
